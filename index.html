        exercise, we'll play around with some common CSS properties to manage and style our fonts by making a
        nice blog post-like web page.</p>-->

    <h2 class="sub-heading">All About Typography</h2>
    <p class="headline-para">Headlines, like this one, are great ways to quickly capture the
        reader's attention, to give them a summary, intro, or other important
        information in a web page. You can use
        text-transform: uppercase; to make a whole body of text
        uppercase using CSS if you really need to grab attention!</p>
    <p>Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which you should do sparingly) - it's time
        to chat more about other components of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif font for our
        headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text. This is intentional! Serif font faces are generally
        considered pretty inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much more difficult to
        visually differentiate the characters from one another. At large font sizes, such as those seen in most
        headings, serif fonts are considered fine, since the larger style makes it easier to see where serif
        characters start and where they end.</p>
    <p>But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page? Another common thing you might see in web
        pages are quotes. To make quotes, we can use the blockquote element and style it accordingly, so it stands
        out a bit as a non-body text quote.</p>
    <blockquote class="quote">"This is a quote - you probably knew that at a glance since we gave it some nice
        styling. Pretty
        nice, huh? A great lesson in User Experience Design, where we take special care to implement our web page in
        a way that makes it pleasant and intuitive for our users/readers. Differentiating our different typography
        components visually makes information much more organized and easier to digest for our users."
